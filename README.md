# OSCP-PREP – Obsidian Notes 🧠🔐

This repository contains my **OSCP (PEN-200) preparation notes**, written in **Markdown** and maintained using **Obsidian**.

My preparation approach is heavily based on completing **OSCP-style TryHackMe rooms** curated in the well-known **Lainkusanagi OSCP-Like spreadsheet**.  
The focus is on **hands-on methodology**, **manual exploitation**, and **exam-relevant skills**, not shortcuts.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this repository is to **systematically complete all TryHackMe rooms listed in the Lainkusanagi OSCP-Like spreadsheet** and document them in a structured, revision-friendly manner.

📄 Reference spreadsheet:  
**Lainkusanagi – OSCP Like.xlsx**  
👉 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18weuz_Eeynr6sXFQ87Cd5F0slOj9Z6rt/htmlview

This list is widely followed by OSCP aspirants because it emphasizes:
- Enumeration-heavy machines
- Manual exploitation
- Realistic privilege escalation paths
- Active Directory attack fundamentals
- OSCP-style problem solving (low hand-holding)

---

## 🧭 Preparation Philosophy

This repository follows **OSCP exam mindset**, not CTF shortcuts.

Core principles:
- Enumeration first, always
- Understand *why* an exploit works
- Minimal automation, maximum understanding
- Clear attack paths that can be repeated under exam pressure

Every note is written with **exam-time revision** in mind.

## 🧠 How Notes Are Written

Each TryHackMe room note generally covers:

- **Initial Enumeration**
  - Network & service discovery
  - Identifying attack surface
- **Exploitation**
  - Vulnerability identification
  - Manual exploitation steps
  - Tool usage with reasoning
- **Privilege Escalation**
  - Local enumeration
  - Misconfigurations
  - Exploitation logic
- **Lessons Learned**
  - What mattered for OSCP
  - Common mistakes
  - Alternate attack paths (if any)

Notes are intentionally **concise but complete**, optimized for fast recall.
